My name is Dylan Campbell and I am currently a student at Arizona State University - Online.

- I'm currently gaining experience with Python, R, and SQL.
- I primarily use  Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda Navigator.
- I have done some school projects on real data from the National Football League (NFL) and Steam (application, storefront).

- I have some other fun projects planned, primarily exploring the world of Data Science through topics I find interesting and unique.
